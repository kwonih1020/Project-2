# Project-2 - Travel Diary

##Approach Taken:

     In order to complete this project with simple CRUD function, I went over all important part of rails.
     For example, models, migration, views, controllers, routes, resources, sessions, flash, validations
     and handling errors. Also, did lots of google search for Rating star system.

##Technologies Used:

     HTML and CSS are used to structuring and styling. Command line, Ruby Gem, Ruby on Rails for functionality. Used jQuery for rating star system.

##Installation Instructions:

     1. Create new repo on github.
     2. Set up a Rails applications. Make brand new rails through command line by typing "rails new Project-2 -d postresql".
     3. Create database.
     4. Create Models.
     5. Rails migration.
     6. Schema.
     7. Seeds.

##Issues:

     The biggest issue throughout this project was Rating system. We never learn Rating system on Ruby, so I google search for this for a long time.

##Deliverables:

     MVP: Make 2 models: Visits and Ratings, and simple CRUD functionality.

     Bronze: User and devise, add CSS works.

     Silver: Rating Star System. Add comment section to visits and ratings.

     Gold: Search bar for navigating to exact visits(city name) to view posts and ratings. Adding Favorite to each models.
